Description: It has been shown that both DNA methylation and RNA transcription 
    are linked to chronological age and age related diseases. Several 
    estimators have been developed to predict human aging from DNA level and 
    RNA level. Most of the human transcriptional age predictor are based on 
    microarray data and limited to only a few tissues. To date, transcriptional 
    studies on aging using RNASeq data from different human tissues is limited.
    The aim of this package is to provide a tool for across-tissue and 
    tissue-specific transcriptional age calculation based on GTEx RNASeq data.
